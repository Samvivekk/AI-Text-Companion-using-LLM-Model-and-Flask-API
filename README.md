# AI-Text-Companion
The text prompt creation form only requires an indication of what type of text you are writing (blog post, LinkedIn post, Tweet, or Email). It optionally accepts a topic and mood parameter. The app then generates a prompt with an instruction to suggest the next words and sends this to the OpenAI API which - using the GPT-3  engine that has been trained on a lot of publicly available text content - predicts the next likely to be used tokens.
